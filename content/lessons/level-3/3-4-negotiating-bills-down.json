Just picking up the phone and asking. That's the power of negotiating your bills, and it's one of the most underused money moves out there."

      "content": "Here's something most people don't realise: it costs companies 5-10 times more to get a new customer than to keep an existing one. Your phone company, your internet provider, your insurance company — they would rather give you a discount than lose you. That's your leverage.\n\nThe average Australian family spends over $200/month on phone and internet alone. Studies show that people who call and negotiate save an average of $30-$50 per bill. That's $360-$600 a year — from a few phone calls."

      "content": "Not every bill is negotiable, but these almost always are:\n\n- Mobile phone plan: Providers have unadvertised plans and loyalty deals. Always ask.\n- Internet/broadband: Especially if you've been on the same plan for over a year.\n- Car insurance: Get a quote from a competitor, then call your current provider.\n- Home & contents insurance: Same strategy — a competing quote is your best weapon.\n- Health insurance: Ask about lower tiers, excess adjustments, or loyalty discounts.\n- Electricity & gas: Compare plans on government comparison sites, then call to switch or negotiate.\n- Gym memberships: Especially if you're not using it much. They'd rather drop the price than lose you.\n- Subscription services: Even streaming services sometimes offer discounted rates if you say you're thinking of cancelling."

I've seen that [Competitor] is offering a similar plan for $[amount]. I'd really like to stay with you — is there anything you can do to match that or offer me a better deal?\"\n\nSCRIPT 2 — Insurance:\n\"Hi, my renewal has come through at $[amount] and it's quite a bit more than I was expecting. I've got a quote from [Competitor] for $[lower amount]. Can you review my policy and see if there's a way to bring the price down? I've been happy with your service and would prefer to stay.\"\n\nSCRIPT 3 — If they say no:\n\"I understand. Could you transfer me to your retentions or cancellations team? I'd like to explore my options before I make a decision.\"\n\nThe retentions team almost always has better deals. That's their whole job — keeping you."

Wait times are shorter and staff are less rushed.\n- Have your current bill in front of you so you can reference exact amounts.\n- Be friendly. The person on the phone is a real human — kindness goes a long way.\n- Write down the name of who you spoke to and what was agreed.\n- If you have kids making noise in the background, don't stress. It happens. The person on the phone gets it.\n- Set a calendar reminder to call again in 12 months. Deals expire and prices creep up."
