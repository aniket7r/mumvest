This one saves you the most money in interest. If you like the idea of paying less overall, this lesson is for you."

You still pay minimums on everything else, but you throw all your extra money at the most expensive debt — the one that's costing you the most each month just to carry."

      "content": "Let's use a real example. Meet Priya, a mum with three kids and these debts:\n\n- Store credit card: $1,500 at 22% interest\n- Personal loan: $4,000 at 12% interest\n- Car loan: $8,000 at 6% interest\n- Family loan (interest-free): $2,000 at 0%\n\nWith the snowball method, Priya would pay off the $1,500 store card first (smallest balance). With the avalanche method, she'd also start with the store card — but for a different reason: it has the highest interest rate at 22%.\n\nNow here's where they differ. If the store card had a $5,000 balance instead, the snowball method would say 'pay the $2,000 family loan first.' The avalanche method would still say 'pay the 22% store card first, because that interest rate is eating you alive.'"

      "content": "Let's say you have $300 extra per month and these three debts:\n\n- Credit card: $2,000 at 20% interest (minimum $50/month)\n- Personal loan: $5,000 at 10% interest (minimum $100/month)\n- Car loan: $3,000 at 5% interest (minimum $80/month)\n\nSnowball order: Credit card ($2,000) -> Car loan ($3,000) -> Personal loan ($5,000)\nAvalanche order: Credit card ($2,000) -> Personal loan ($5,000) -> Car loan ($3,000)\n\nIn this case, both methods start with the credit card. But after that, the avalanche tackles the 10% personal loan next, while the snowball tackles the smaller $3,000 car loan.\n\nThe result? The avalanche saves you roughly $400-$600 in total interest over the life of your repayment. That's real money — a family day out, new school shoes, or a boost to your emergency fund."

Start with the snowball to build confidence by clearing one or two small debts, then switch to the avalanche for the bigger ones. There are no rules — just progress."
