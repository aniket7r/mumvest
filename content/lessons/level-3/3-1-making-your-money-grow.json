Here's why:\n\nImagine you save $50/week and earn 7% annual returns (the historical stock market average). After 1 year, you have $2,725. Nice. But after 10 years? $37,500. After 20 years? $113,000. After 30 years? $264,000.\n\nYou only put in $78,000 of your own money over 30 years. The other $186,000? That's compound interest — your money earning money on its money."

And investing doesn't need to be complicated. A simple index fund — which automatically buys a little piece of hundreds of companies — is how most millionaires invest. Seriously."
