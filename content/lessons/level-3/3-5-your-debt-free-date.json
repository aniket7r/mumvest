Just your income, your family, and complete freedom to choose what you do with every dollar. That morning has a date — and in this lesson, we're going to find it."

      "content": "\"I want to be debt-free\" is a dream. \"I will be debt-free by March 2028\" is a plan. When you put a date on your goal, something shifts in your brain. It stops being a vague wish and starts being a countdown. You can see it on the calendar. You can work backward from it. You can measure your progress every single month.\n\nStudies show that people with specific financial goals are 42% more likely to achieve them than people with vague intentions. A date gives your snowball or avalanche a finish line."

      "content": "Here's the simple maths. Don't worry — it's easier than it looks.\n\nStep 1: Add up ALL your debts. Every credit card, personal loan, store account, money owed to family — everything. Write down one total number.\n\nStep 2: Work out how much you can put toward debt each month. This is your minimum payments PLUS any extra you can squeeze out of your budget.\n\nStep 3: Divide your total debt by your monthly payment. That gives you roughly how many months until you're free.\n\nExample:\n- Total debt: $12,000\n- Monthly payment: $500\n- $12,000 / $500 = 24 months\n- That's 2 years from today.\n\nThis is a simplified calculation — interest will stretch it a bit — but it gives you a powerful starting target. And if you use the snowball or avalanche method from our previous lessons, you'll likely beat that date."

The question is: do you want to arrive at 2029 still carrying the same debt, or do you want to arrive there FREE?\n\nAnd here are ways to speed it up:\n\n- Negotiate your bills down (Lesson 3-4) and put the savings toward debt: could save $100-$200/month\n- Sell things you don't need: old baby gear, clothes the kids have outgrown, that exercise bike collecting dust. Even $500 from a weekend of selling shortens your timeline.\n- Pick up a side earner: weekend market stall, online tutoring, freelance work during nap time. Even $200/month extra cuts years off your debt.\n- Use windfalls wisely: tax return, family gifts, work bonuses. Put at least half toward debt."

      "type": "text",
      "content": "Here's a powerful way to think about it:\n\n- $12,000 in debt paying $400/month = debt-free in about 30 months (2.5 years)\n- Same debt paying $600/month = debt-free in about 20 months (under 2 years)\n- Same debt paying $800/month = debt-free in 15 months (just over a year)\n\nEvery extra $50/month matters. That's one less takeaway dinner. One fewer impulse buy. And it could shave months off your journey."
