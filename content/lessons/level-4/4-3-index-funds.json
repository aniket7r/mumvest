We're talking about index funds \u2014 and they're about to become your new best friend. No stock-picking. No stressing over which company to choose. Just a simple, proven approach that even billionaire investors swear by."

Instead of picking one company and hoping it does well, you own a little bit of all of them. Think of it like this: instead of betting everything on one horse in a race, you own a piece of every horse. As long as the race keeps running, you win."

Mum B sets up an automatic $50 monthly investment into an index fund and goes about her life \u2014 school runs, meal prep, bedtime stories. After 15 years, studies show that Mum B almost certainly has more money. In fact, over 90% of professional stock pickers \u2014 people who do this full-time \u2014 fail to beat a simple index fund over the long run."

They're proven \u2014 the S&P 500 index has averaged about 10% annual returns over decades\n\nYou don't need to become a finance expert. You just need to pick a solid index fund, set up a regular contribution, and let compound interest work its magic."

A total market index fund means you own a slice of practically every publicly traded company. That's thousands of companies working for your family's future while you focus on what matters most."
