      "content": "One of the biggest myths about investing is that you need a lot of money to get started. \"I'll invest when I have more money\" is the most expensive sentence in the English language. The truth? Starting with $25 a month will put you ahead of the vast majority of people who keep waiting for the \"right time\" that never comes."

      "content": "Think about what you spend $25 on without thinking twice: a couple of coffees out, a kids' magazine subscription, a takeaway meal. Now imagine redirecting just that much into your future. You'd barely notice it leaving your account each month, but in 20 years, that $25 a month could grow to over $14,000. That's real money grown from pocket change."

      "content": "\"I'll wait until the market dips to invest.\" Sound smart? It's actually a trap. Studies have shown that if you missed just the 10 best days in the stock market over the past 20 years, your returns would be cut in more than half. The problem is, nobody knows when those best days will happen. They often come right after the worst days, when everyone is too scared to invest."

      "content": "Here's a fun fact: researchers tested three investing strategies over decades. Investor A had perfect timing and invested at the market low every single year. Investor B invested on the first of every month no matter what (this is called dollar-cost averaging). Investor C had the worst timing and invested at the market peak every year. The result? All three made money. And the difference between perfect timing and terrible timing was surprisingly small. Consistency beat timing every single time."

Make sure your emergency fund is on track\n3. Check what's left after essentials and a little fun money\n4. Start with an amount that feels comfortable \u2014 even $10\n5. Increase it by $5 every few months as you get more confident\n\nThe golden rule: invest money you won't need for at least 5 years. This gives your investments time to ride out any bumps. Money for next month's groceries? Keep that in your bank account. Money for your child's university in 15 years? That's investing money."

That's from putting aside less than $2 a day. Less than a coffee. You're not sacrificing today to invest \u2014 you're just redirecting a tiny stream of money toward a river of future wealth."
