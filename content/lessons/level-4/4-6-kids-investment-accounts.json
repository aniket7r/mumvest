Whether it's for university, their first car, a gap year, or a deposit on a home \u2014 starting now gives them a head start that money can't buy later. And the best part? There are special accounts designed exactly for this."

If you invest just $25 a month from birth, by the time your child turns 18, that could be worth about $12,000. Leave it growing until they're 30 and it could be over $35,000 \u2014 from just $25 a month. That's the gift of time combined with compound interest."

You manage it until they reach adulthood (usually 18 or 21, depending on your state). Here's what makes them great:\n\n\u2022 No limit on what the money can be used for \u2014 university, a car, starting a business, anything\n\u2022 You control the investments until your child is old enough\n\u2022 Easy to open at the same platforms we discussed \u2014 Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab\n\u2022 You can start with as little as $1\n\nThe one thing to know: once your child reaches the legal age, the money becomes theirs. It's their account \u2014 you're just the custodian until then."

Here's why mums love them:\n\n\u2022 Your money grows tax-free (that means you keep more of the gains)\n\u2022 Withdrawals for education expenses are also tax-free\n\u2022 You can use it for university tuition, room and board, textbooks, even K-12 private school (up to $10,000/year)\n\u2022 Grandparents, aunties, and friends can contribute \u2014 perfect for birthday gifts\n\u2022 If one child doesn't use it, you can transfer it to a sibling\n\nA 529 plan with $50 a month from birth could grow to over $24,000 by the time your child starts university. That's a huge chunk of tuition covered."

Instead of another toy she'll forget about, you open a 529 plan and put in $500 from birthday money from the family. Then you add $30 a month. By the time she's 18, that account could hold over $15,000 \u2014 all from small, steady contributions. Now imagine her face when you tell her that her education is taken care of. That's a gift no toy could ever match."

Most platforms walk you through it step by step. You'll need your child's name, date of birth, and Social Security number. The whole process takes about 10 minutes. And just like with your own account, set up automatic contributions so you never have to remember to do it."
