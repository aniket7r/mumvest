And the best part? It does most of the work for you. All you have to do is start early and stay consistent."

It's like a snowball rolling downhill \u2014 it starts small, but it picks up more and more snow the further it goes. The longer you let it roll, the bigger it gets."

At an average return of 8% per year, here's what happens:\n\nAfter 10 years: You've put in $3,000 \u2192 It's grown to about $4,600\nAfter 20 years: You've put in $6,000 \u2192 It's grown to about $14,700\nAfter 30 years: You've put in $9,000 \u2192 It's grown to about $37,500\n\nRead that last one again. You put in $9,000 of your own money, and compound interest added over $28,000 on top. That's your money making money making money."

Lisa waits until her child is 10, then invests $50 a month for the next 20 years (total invested: $12,000). By the time both kids turn 30, Sarah's money has grown to more than Lisa's \u2014 even though Sarah invested half as much. That's the magic of starting early. Time beats money, every single time."
