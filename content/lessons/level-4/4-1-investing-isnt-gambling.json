A lot of mums feel the same way. But here's the truth: investing and gambling are completely different things, and understanding why is your first step toward building real wealth for your family."

The odds are stacked against you, and over time, you're almost guaranteed to lose. Investing is the opposite. When you invest, you're buying a tiny piece of a real business that makes real products, earns real money, and grows over time. You're not betting \u2014 you're owning."

That means if you invested $1,000 and left it alone for 10 years, it would have grown to roughly $2,600. Yes, there are bumps along the way \u2014 some years the market drops 20%, other years it jumps 30%. But zoom out, and the line goes up. Every single 20-year period in stock market history has been positive. Every one."

But if you keep watering, keep tending to it, and give it enough time \u2014 you'll have a beautiful harvest. The mums who build wealth aren't the ones who got lucky. They're the ones who started, stayed patient, and let time do the heavy lifting."

In 18 years \u2014 by the time your little one finishes school \u2014 that could grow to over $27,000 at average market returns. That's school fees, a first car, or a deposit on their first flat. You didn't gamble for it. You grew it, steadily and patiently, like the brilliant mum you are."
