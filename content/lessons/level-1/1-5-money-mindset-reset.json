That's not an exaggeration — research from Cambridge University shows that our core money habits are formed by age seven, based on what we saw our parents and caregivers do.\n\nIf your parents argued about money, you might avoid thinking about it.\nIf money was scarce, you might struggle to spend even when you can afford to.\nIf money was never discussed, you might feel shame about learning the basics now."
