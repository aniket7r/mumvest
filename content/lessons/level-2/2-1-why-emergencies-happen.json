The question isn't IF an emergency will happen, it's WHEN.\n\nHere's what makes them devastating: it's not the cost itself, it's the scramble. When you don't have savings, a $500 repair becomes a $500 repair PLUS $200 in credit card interest PLUS the stress of figuring out how to pay next month's bills."
