You never see the money in your spending account, so you never miss it.\n\nHere's the setup:\n\n1. Pick your savings amount (start small — $25/week is fine)\n2. Set up an automatic transfer for payday\n3. The money moves before you can spend it\n4. Your spending account gets what's left\n5. You live on what's left — and it works because you adjust naturally"

Because manual saving requires a decision every single time — 'Should I save this week?' With automation, saving is the default. Not saving would require effort."
