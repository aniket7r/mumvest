      "content": "Made famous by Dave Ramsey, the snowball method is simple:\n\n1. List all debts from smallest balance to largest\n2. Pay minimums on everything\n3. Throw every extra dollar at the smallest debt\n4. When it's paid off, roll that payment into the next smallest\n\nWhy it works: You get quick wins. Paying off that first small debt gives you a dopamine hit and proves the system works. Motivation matters more than math for most people."

Throw every extra dollar at the highest-interest debt\n4. When it's paid off, roll that payment into the next highest\n\nWhy it works: You save the most money on interest over time. If you're motivated by pure logic and maximum savings, this is your method."
