Keeping emergency money separate from spending money is crucial — out of sight, out of temptation.\n\n2. Set a weekly savings amount. Even $20/week gets you to $500 in 25 weeks — about 6 months.\n\n3. Boost it with windfalls. Tax refund? Birthday money? Sell something you don't use? Every lump sum gets you there faster."
