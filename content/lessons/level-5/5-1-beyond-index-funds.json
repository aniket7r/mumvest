      "content": "Think of bonds like lending money to the government or a big company. They promise to pay you back with interest. A $1,000 bond paying 4% gives you $40 per year - not flashy, but consistent. Bonds don't jump around in price like stocks do. When the stock market drops 20%, bonds often hold steady or even go up. That's why many investors keep 20-40% of their money in bonds, especially as they get older."

      "content": "REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) let you invest in property - shopping centres, apartment buildings, hospitals - without actually buying a building. You can invest as little as $50. The best part? REITs are required by law to pay out 90% of their profits to investors, which means regular income landing in your account. It's like being a landlord without ever fixing a leaky tap."

      "content": "Diversification just means spreading your money across different types of investments so that if one goes down, the others can help cushion the fall. Imagine you have $10,000 to invest. Instead of putting it all in one place, you might split it: $5,000 in index funds, $2,000 in bonds, $2,000 in REITs, and $1,000 in an international fund. If stocks drop 15%, your bonds and REITs might only drop 3% - so your overall loss is much smaller."

      "content": "Here's a simple rule of thumb: subtract your age from 110. That's roughly the percentage you might keep in stocks, with the rest in bonds and other investments. So if you're 35, that's about 75% stocks and 25% bonds/other. If you're 45, it's about 65% stocks and 35% bonds/other. It's not a hard rule, but it's a solid starting point."
