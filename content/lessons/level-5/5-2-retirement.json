      "content": "Retirement might feel like a lifetime away - or it might feel terrifyingly close. Either way, the single most important thing to know is this: starting now, even with small amounts, is dramatically better than waiting. A mum who invests $200 per month starting at age 30 will have roughly $400,000 by age 65. Wait until 40 to start the same $200 per month? You'd end up with about $175,000. That 10-year head start is worth over $225,000. But even if you're starting at 40, 45, or 50 - you can still build something meaningful."

      "content": "These are all just special accounts designed to help you save for retirement, with tax benefits as a bonus. A pension is a plan where your employer puts money aside for you (these are rarer now, but some jobs still offer them). A 401(k) is an account your employer offers where you contribute from your pay cheque - and many employers will match your contributions. That match is literally free money. If your employer matches 3%, and you put in 3% of your $50,000 salary ($1,500), they add another $1,500. That's a 100% return on day one. An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is one you open yourself. You can contribute up to $7,000 per year (or $8,000 if you're 50+). The money grows tax-free or tax-deferred depending on the type."

      "content": "A common guideline is that you'll need about 25 times your annual expenses saved up for retirement. If you spend $40,000 per year, that's roughly $1,000,000. Sounds huge, right? But remember, this builds up over decades. You don't need to save a million dollars from your pay cheque - your investments grow and compound over time. Even $300 per month invested over 30 years at an average 7% return grows to about $340,000. Add in employer matches, pay rises, and Social Security or state pension, and the picture gets much brighter."
